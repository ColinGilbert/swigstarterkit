Lua is the only language with embedded support, currently.

A top level make will provide an executable at src/ssk which uses the embedded lua feature.

example:

'src/ssk lua swig/lua/examples/test.lua'

I have not yet figured out how to change the search path that lua uses to find loadable modules for the standalone case.

So, to use the lua loadable module you might do this:

cd examples
cp ../.libs/swigstarterkit.so .
lua loadabletest.lua
