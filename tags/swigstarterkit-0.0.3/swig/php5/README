NOTE: PHP5 support is NOT fully working. Anyone who is able to help with this, please do.

It may be as simple as upgrading my version of swig, but I am currently trying to stick with what is available in the latest shipping Ubuntu.

A 'make install' here will create the file:

build/config.m4

to build the (non-working) php module:

cd build
phpize
./configure
make install
